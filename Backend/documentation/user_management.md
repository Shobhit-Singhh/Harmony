## 🔄 User State Management

```
Active ──────► Suspended ──────► Deactivated ──────► Deleted
  ▲               ▲                   ▲                 │
  │               │                   │                 │
  └───────────────┴───────────────────┴─────────────────┘
                    (Admin Only)
```

## 🛡️ Privacy Controls

```python
privacy_settings = {
    "show_profile": True,      # Profile visible to others
    "show_email": False,       # Email visible (future)
    "show_phone": False,       # Phone visible (future)  
    "show_in_search": True,    # Appears in search results
    "allow_messages": True     # Can receive messages (future)
}
```

## 📊 Mental Health Specific Features

### Pillar Weights System
```python
primary_pillar_weights = {
    "health": 0.4,        # 40% focus on health
    "work": 0.3,          # 30% focus on work/career
    "growth": 0.2,        # 20% focus on personal growth
    "relationships": 0.1   # 10% focus on relationships
}
# Total must equal 1.0
```

### Health Information
- **Medications**: Structured format with name, dosage, frequency
- **Conditions**: Array of health conditions
- **Crisis Contact**: Emergency contact information
- **Age Validation**: 13+ years required for platform use

## 🚀 Usage Examples
